    <p>This narrow space was challenged to us by the client to create an entertaining area in the unused, narrow strip between the house and the rear fence. The clients wanted lawn for the kids to play on whilst allowing the adults to entertain friends and family. The clients also requested that we use a mix of new and recycled products and a variety of low maintenance plants. The use of an old recycled laundry sink built into the seating as an Esky added a unique touch to the overall design.</p>

    <p>This garden was designed to reflect different landscapes suited to different climatic areas around the property. With areas taking in the beating mid-day sun being planted with natives, drought tolerant grasses and succulents. While areas subject to prolonged shade were filled with palms and soft ground cover. This garden was designed with passion and thought and is a representative example of Jenni's talent as a Garden Designer.</p>
