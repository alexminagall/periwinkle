    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <h3>Boutique Garden Design &amp; Creation in Melbourne</h3>
    <p>We are a small boutique garden design and landscaping business that has predominantly operated in the Bayside region of Melbourne for the past 15 years. What started out with one woman's passion for the outdoor landscape and her desire to create gardens that reflect that passion has now developed into a full scale landscape design &amp; construction business offering everything from maintenance to full garden renovations. Now even as a bigger business, this passion is what drives us and can be seen by the work we do.</p>

    <h2>DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-6">

    <h3>Combining Passion, Experience &amp; Intuition</h3>

    <p>Designing a landscape is all about taking an ounce of inspiration, and carving that into a garden that appeals to all the senses; that elicits an emotional response, be it a place of peace and relaxation, or of vibrancy and energy. It needs to be more than just aesthetically pleasing, but also functional and built to last.</p>

    <p>At Periwinkle, we don't just plan your garden to look amazing on the day we finish, but to look amazing in years to come and to fit in seamlessly with your lifestyle. We have witnessed many gardens where landscapers focus only on the short term results, ignoring the reality of their product as a living garden â€“ they fill the garden with plants so that it looks good in the short term, but within a few months the garden is overgrown and needs significant maintenance. We plan for your gardens growth, so that the beauty of your garden grows alongside the plants.</p>

    <p>At Periwinkle, environmental sustainability is a grounding principle that shapes our designs. We are inspired by the spectacular Australian landscape that thrives despite harsh conditions, and we incorporate an understanding of this into all our designs, embedding resilience into our gardens. We prepare for harsh suns, cool winters and long periods without rain, through clever selection and arrangement of plants, among other things.</p>

    <p>Most of all, we build your garden for you. We take our experience, and your desires and together create a garden that you love to be in.<p>
