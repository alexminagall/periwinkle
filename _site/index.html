  <h2>WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY</h2>
  <section class="grid-centered">
    <div class="col-6">
      <div class="refz">
        <p>I absolutely love what Periwinkle has done with my outdoor space. They turned an awkward overgrown area into perfect space for entertaining. Would recommend them to all of my friends.</p>
        <p class="name">- Tina ( Cheltenham)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="refz">
        <p>Thanks to Jen and Emile for transforming our unusable front yard into an amazingly beautiful space. Looking forward to spending time in a beautifully designed space. Jen listened to what we were after and made it happen. It was a wonderful experience working with Periwinkle to achieve a special space. Thanks!</p>

        <p>Periwinkle Designs worked tirelessly to make sure that I was completely satisfied with how my outdoor areas looked. They were professional, but also welcoming and understanding. I cannot thank them enough.</p>
        <p class="name">- James ( Parkdale)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="refz">
        <p>Jeni has an unbelievable gift of nurturing and transforming gardens. Whenever she spends time in our garden, she moves a few plants here, cuts a few back there, finds a pot to place in just the right spot and the results are transformative. She has a flair for landscaping, backed up by a great knowledge of plants and horticulture.</p>
        <p class="name">- Kinane</p>
      </div>
      <div class="refz">
        <p>Periwinkle garden design came to our resume when our giant dog completely destroyed our yard. Not only did they come up with a totally new layout for the yard which was 100% better then before but they had it finished in a matter of days without any hiccups. We now now have a beautiful functional yard we can play with our 16 month old. Our dog destroying it was blessing in disguise. I cannot recommend them enough.</p>
