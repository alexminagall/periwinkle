    <p>Over the years we have worked with many clients that want to give new life to their garden before selling their property, as we both know that a beautiful, functional garden can add thousands to the value of the house. The client at this property wanted to take the outdated, dysfunctional garden and create a space that any potential buyers could see themselves in. We cleared away a large proportion of the garden in the backyard and added a large lawn area for kids to play in, while in the front garden we created a very low maintenance garden that bought a touch of modern to the garden while still embracing the age of the house.</p>

    <p>This garden was designed to reflect different landscapes suited to different climatic areas around the property. With areas taking in the beating mid-day sun being planted with natives, drought tolerant grasses and succulents. While areas subject to prolonged shade were filled with palms and soft ground cover. This garden was designed with passion and thought and is a representative example of Jenni's talent as a Garden Designer.</p>

    <p>When we came to this garden it had become tired and overgrown; the client wanted to strip back the grass from both the front and back gardens and lay new lawn, clear out the front gardens plants and trees and start fresh while reorganizing and adding new plants to the back garden. Keeping in theme with the house we created a cottage style garden with soft ground cover and flowering plants. We carried through the same theme into the back garden but used more edible plants, such as herbs, citrus trees and olives. Like all gardens we create, this garden was designed to grow into itself and evolve, ensuring that as the plants grew they wouldn't overgrow the space.</p>

    <p>This narrow space was challenged to us by the client to create an entertaining area in the unused, narrow strip between the house and the rear fence. The clients wanted lawn for the kids to play on whilst allowing the adults to entertain friends and family. The clients also requested that we use a mix of new and recycled products and a variety of low maintenance plants. The use of an old recycled laundry sink built into the seating as an Esky added a unique touch to the overall design.</p>

    <p>This garden began as a clean slate, with only the large stone Buddah Statue and hedge along the fence being in the garden. The client requested that the dominance of the statue be retained, using it as a focus point and theme for the garden. We designed the garden to be tranquil and peaceful, utilizing tropical low maintenance plants, with maximum colour and vibrancy. The use of old hardwood railway sleepers as a sweeping pathway softens the garden while bringing in curves to the small square space.</p>
