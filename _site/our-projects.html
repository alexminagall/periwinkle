    <p>This narrow space was challenged to us by the client to create an entertaining area in the unused, narrow strip between the house and the rear fence. The clients wanted lawn for the kids to play on whilst allowing the adults to entertain friends and family. The clients also requested that we use a mix of new and recycled products and a variety of low maintenance plants. The use of an old recycled laundry sink built into the seating as an Esky added a unique touch to the overall design.</p>

With areas taking in the beating mid-day sun being planted with natives, drought tolerant grasses and succulents. While areas subject to prolonged shade were filled with palms and soft ground cover. This garden was designed with passion and thought and is a representative example of Jenni's talent as a Garden Designer.</p>

    <p>When we came to this garden it had become tired and overgrown; the client wanted to strip back the grass from both the front and back gardens and lay new lawn, clear out the front gardens plants and trees and start fresh while reorganizing and adding new plants to the back garden. Keeping in theme with the house we created a cottage style garden with soft ground cover and flowering plants. We carried through the same theme into the back garden but used more edible plants, such as herbs, citrus trees and olives. Like all gardens we create, this garden was designed to grow into itself and evolve, ensuring that as the plants grew they wouldn't overgrow the space.</p>

    <p>Over the years we have worked with many clients that want to give new life to their garden before selling their property, as we both know that a beautiful, functional garden can add thousands to the value of the house. The client at this property wanted to take the outdated, dysfunctional garden and create a space that any potential buyers could see themselves in. We cleared away a large proportion of the garden in the backyard and added a large lawn area for kids to play in, while in the front garden we created a very low maintenance garden that bought a touch of modern to the garden while still embracing the age of the house.</p>

  <div class="texty">
    <p>The clients here required the front garden to be remodeled and the back garden to be designed from scratch. The existing front garden offered some complementing aspects to the style of house, but was overgrown, poorly designed and built. So using the aspects of the garden that worked, we re- sculpted the landscape by adding new plants and features that transformed the space into a more beautiful, more colorful and interesting space. The rear garden was required to complement the much more modern styling of the house and give a feeling of a tropical oasis. This was achieved with a mix of colorful tropical plants, bamboo and expansive decking. The use of bamboo down the side of the property made for a much more interesting and colorful screen to block out the neighbors next door, than conventional wood or hard screens.</p>

    <p>This garden began as a clean slate, with only the large stone Buddah Statue and hedge along the fence being in the garden. The client requested that the dominance of the statue be retained, using it as a focus point and theme for the garden. We designed the garden to be tranquil and peaceful, utilizing tropical low maintenance plants, with maximum colour and vibrancy. The use of old hardwood railway sleepers as a sweeping pathway softens the garden while bringing in curves to the small square space.</p>

    <p>This large backyard lacked form and beauty, with simple lawn covering every inch. The clients wanted a space that introduced curves to draw attention away from the fence lines, which was achieved by the low limestone wall and circular crazy paving, providing a new focus point in the garden. The clients also asked for a garden that not only offered low maintenance and beauty but also smells and taste, which we achieved with a mix of herbaceous ground cover and hedging along with two large raised vegetable gardens. As an avid gardener the client also wanted a space that she could work on herself and feel a sense of connection with the garden, so by planting fruit trees and the veggie gardens it ticks all the boxes of form and function.</p>
